Big ideas:
- Allow processes to give each other time? Main motivation is the potential of services being overwhelmed, could
  instead make it so services have a limited amount of time they spend fairly between requests, requesting programs
  can give time to services to make things happen faster.
- Process grouping? Processes can be in multiple groups, only able to communicate with other proccesses in same group.
    - (First idea) Store a bitmap with each process. Has the problem of heavily limiting number of possible groups or
      needing a massive bitmap.
    - (Better idea) Store groups as 31-bit numbers (1 bit for present), store two inside process structure, linked
      list of single page hash tables.
- Come up with more ideas to speed up sending data:
    - Implement huge page support, should help a lot with big blocks of data.
        - Improve physical page allocator, maybe some kind of buddy allocator?
        - Maybe some kind of big page hint/requirement when process allocates segments? Could also help with DMA
          buffers.
    - Find situations in which we can just move entire page table tree between processes.
- Including owner tracking data in segment along with total number of pages used, so unmapping segments gives pages
  back to original owner.
- RDBMS for the filesystem? Think MySQL can use raw partitions. Might be an easy way to get a decent filesystem up
  and running.

Practical stuff:
- Finish multiboot implementation
- Implement KASLR
- Redesign heap to be linked list of page pools, don't remap into kernel area
- Allocate space for framebuffer in upper memory, map near start of kernel (probably not required in future, moving
  framebuffer to userspace)
- Write menu configuration tool
- Add more configuration options to disable certain features
- Implement kernel argument parsing
- Implement platform feature detection
- Mark kernel pages as global instead of mapping higher half into every new page table (is there any point to this?)

Virtual Memory Allocation:
- Currently force mapping unmaps all the old pages, then maps all the new pages. This could probably be faster if we
  just changed the page flags.
- Maybe add immutable segment mappings for unusable areas?

Process threading:
- VMA system currently creates and removes mappings in a very non-atomic fashion. Figure out some locking scheme for
  this that allows other threads to continue doing tasks (preferably able to map memory too):
    - (First idea) Invalidate upper level page table entry, mark as being modified (integrate in UnmapMemTask).
    - (Better idea) Remove segment first, unmap pages after so that page faults (shouldn't happen anyway) don't result
      in pages being remapped in the segment.
      Keep a list of new segments being added, so threads don't try to map in the same area at the same time.
- OOM conditions when overwriting mappings are currently unrecoverable. Figure out some plan for this.
    - (Option 1) Just unmap the whole overwritten area and return error state.
    - (Option 2) Somehow make the process reversible (probably needs a lot more memory).
    - (Option 3) Precalculate the memory usage difference the operation will incur, so we know if an OOM will occur
      before we start (ideal, but more difficult).

Old:
- Change 'out' folders to 'zig-out'
[We seem to be switching to Rust over time, so likely unnecessary]
- Write documentation comments using "//#" as start, set Vim to automatically fold documentation
[Ditto, plus rustdoc is pretty great so module comments are probably good enough]
- Write tool to convert between Markdown/Vimwiki and Zig with documentation comments
[Ditto]
